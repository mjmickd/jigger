    > An application that will allow you to browse cocktails, with the cocktail name, an image of the cocktail, the instructions of how to make the cocktail, and the ingredients used while being able to add it to your favorites or delete it from your favorites. 

## How the Application Works

>After an account is created, you're able to search for a cocktail outside of the database. 

>After searching for a cocktail you're able to then add it to you're landing page. 

>Once on the landing page, you're then able to favorite the cocktail and route yourself to a page to learn more about the cocktail itself.

Next Steps: 

 -I would like to implement interactive comments that would be able to be connected to a cocktail. 

 - I would like to be able to create a cocktail that you've created yourself
